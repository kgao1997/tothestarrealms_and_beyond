Heuristic Function Writeup (Based on Darwin Kastle's Analysis at https://www.starrealms.com/strategy-article-by-darwin-kastle/)

Game Split into three sections: 

Opening: Game start until: 
  1. Both Life Totals < 40
  2. Both players pass Third turn
Objective function for opening phase:
  1. Obtain scrapping cards -> want to remove starting cards from deck as soon as possible (Vipers and Basic 1 Power cards)
  2. Evaluate available trade pool. Identify strategy: 
    a. If bomb-tier cards exist in pool, prioritize obtaining trade resource cards to "ramp" into bomb
    b. Then prioritize unconditional cantrips (since they offer no cost in card advantage)
    c. If smaller cards available, prioritize drafting multiple cards of the same faction (such as Blob Fighter for Blobs, etc)
  3.  At end of opening phase, strategies will be decided. For reference, card faction to strategy will be tallied as follows: 
    a. Red -> Scrap own cards to improve the quality of cards drawn in mid to late game.
    b. Yellow -> Play cards, focus on no resource gain but disrupting opponent's hand
    c. Blob -> Synergy with other Blob cards. With Blob, prioritize obtaining Blob cards
    d. Blue -> Gain life and draw through cards.
  4. Archetype Card -> Trade Cruiser - 
    a. Obtain Cruiser-> evaluate base cards above all else due to raw power level. 
    
 Midgame -> When both players are between 30-50 life (to account for Machine Orthodoxy's strategy of gaining life and resources). 
    1. Players begin to scrap Explorers
    2. Player primary faction determined to various weights. Focus on obtaining cards of player's faction while still establishing a 
       secondary faction. 
  
  Lategame -> Evaluate the function deeply to see how to optimize damage. Use Heuristic function based on weighting damage/resources 
  based on 
  
Bomb Class Cards (Cards that would trigger resource-ramp tactics): (In order of impact)
  The Hive
  Blob World
  Embassy Yacht -> Write a specific heuristic function that will take into account the existence of Embassy Yacht for calculations
  Command Ship
  Brain World -> Narrow, but amount of early game card advantage this creates is absurd. 
  Fleet HQ

Generic Priority: 
  Recycling Station -> Utility of this card is too good to be ignored. If a Recycling Station is available, should immediately kill
  
Computation of card pick value (Formula) -> Use a sigmoidal activation function based on game state to adjust card's value
(Will use sigmoidal functions). 
Resource = 1
Value of Damage -> cardDamage * sigmoid(opposingHealth/40)
Value of Authority (Health) -> cardAuthority * sigmoid(-currentHealth / 40)
Value of Card Advantage -> 1 card = 3 points
Value of Trigger abilities (For card evaluation) -> %of two cards in 5 card hand * change in card value after applying trigger effect.
